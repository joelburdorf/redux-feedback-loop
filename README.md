# Project Name
## redux-feedback-loop-master


## Description
### This is a multi-part form that allows users to leave feedback for the day. There are 6 components that show 5 total pages to submit inputs to a SQL database. The results are stored in the Redux store and then accessed from the Redux store and posted to the DOM on the review page. The user is able to review before submitting and then they are brought back to the first page to add another feedback. If a user chooses to not enter a value they will receive an alert to remind them to add a value before they are allowed to move forward.
